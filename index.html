										<h3><b>Short Time Work and the Unemployment Scar</b> [Job Market Paper]</h3>
										<p>Short-time work is a policy tool which subsidizes employment during recessions. I develop a heterogeneous agents model for which the income process is generated by a basic job ladder model with human capital and use it to assess welfare effects and re-distributive consequences of short-time work. I calibrate the model to match the German labor market around the Great Recession and the unemployment scar, the severe and lasting consequences of unemployment, in Germany. The rate at which short-time workers transition to unemployment and the decline of their human capital are informed by matched employer employee social security data. My calibration shows that short-time work softens the initial blow of the recession, slows the recovery, and results in higher medium term output as it prevents the loss of human capital. Rich workers at the top of the job ladder benefit most strongly, as they stand to lose both human capital and the high wages they negotiated previously. Workers with high human capital at the bottom of the job ladder also benefit strongly, as they are exceptionally poor and also stand to lose their human capital.</p>

										<h3><b>Why Britain? The Right Place (in the Technology Space) at the Right Time</b></h3>
										<p>with <a href="http://walkerhanlon.com/">W. Walker Hanlon</a> and <a href="https://lukasrosenberger.github.io/academic/">Lukas Rosenberger</a>
										<br>
									  presented at NBER in 2022 Summer</p>

										<p>Why did Britain attain economic leadership during the Industrial Revolution? We argue that Britain possessed an important but underappreciated innovation advantage: British inventors worked in technologies that were more central within the innovation network. We offer a new approach for measuring the innovation network using patent data from Britain and France in the 18th and early 19th century. We show that the network influenced innovation outcomes and then demonstrate that British inventors worked in more central technologies within the innovation network than inventors from France. Then, drawing on recently-developed theoretical tools, we quantify the implications for technology growth rates in Britain compared to France. Our results indicate that the shape of the innovation network, and the location of British inventors within it, can help explain the more rapid technological growth in Britain during the Industrial Revolution.</p>

										<h3><b>Invention and Technological Leadership during the Industrial Revolution</b></h3>
										<p>with <a href="https://lukasrosenberger.github.io/academic/">Lukas Rosenberger</a> and Emre E. Yavuz</b>
										<p>This paper provides the first empirical cross-country evidence on inventive activity during the Industrial Revolution. Idiosyncrasies in the French historic patent law allow us to compare invention rates in Britain and France across sectors based on French patent data from 1791 to 1855. Our key result is a robust, positive association of invention rates in Britain and France at the sectoral level. Furthermore, we provide the first quantitative evidence on technological leadership in invention at the sectoral level. The evidence informs a debate about whether the acceleration of technological progress during the Industrial Revolution mainly was a British or a European achievement, which has implications for theories of growth and innovation. </p>

								<h3><b>Central Bank Accounts For All</b></h3>
								<p>I develop a simple model of banking in which central bank accounts for all are equivalent to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). I use the model to outline conditions under which a CBDC can be beneficial for financial stability. In the absence of any policy intervention the equilibrium is inefficient as deposit insurance induces banks to act irresponsible. A CBDC can help if the central bank hands what it receives for issuing currency to banks, and requires the right type of collateral in exchange. This collateral should be valuable, especially when the financial market experiences an episode of distress.</p>

								<h3><b>Are Recursive Neural Networks Useful for Macroeconomic Forecasting?</b></h3>
								with <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/federicopuglisi/">Federico Puglisi</a> and Emre E. Yavuz</b>
								<p>We horse-race a Bayesian VAR with hierarchical priors, one of the state of the art macroeconomic forecasting models, with different neural networks. These include a simple recursive neural network (RNN), an RNN with a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and a GRU regularized such that it shrinks towards withe noise (GRU-VAR). We find that any suffciently flexible, and well regularized model has similar forecasting performance as the Bayesian VAR in one step ahead forecasts. We find that our GRU-VAR easily outperforms the Bayesian VAR in forecasts that go further than one step ahead.</p>
